# Support Guidelines <3

## For Members

### We're here for you

When you feel like you just need to talk, that's what we're here for. <3

However, we are not a crisis resource. If you are currently in crisis, please access proper crisis resources instead. We're not trained to support members through crisis, but we ARE here when you're ready to slow down and talk about things.

### Getting Started

We offer anonymous peer support for users 18+. Wait times can vary from a few minutes to a day, and chats are limited to one per three days.

In the meantime, feel free to vent while you're waiting--we'll deliver your messages to your listener when they connect. Thank you for coming to see us today--we know it's hard sometimes! <3

### Keeping You Safe

We will not share your username with your listener. Keeping you anonymous allows us to build you a resilient peer support network and keep you safe while you work to be the best you!

For this reason, please don't share personally identifiable information with your listener. If you're asked for your username or other contact information, please report the listener immediately, and we'll find someone more suitable to support you!

### During Your Chat

You lead the conversation--the listener is just helping you paddle. <3

We can try to match you with peers familiar with certain topics or conditions you select. We are not concerned with diagnosis and will not judge. <3

To save messages that resonate with you (supportive messages from listeners, lightbulb moments, or bits of text you feel represent you well), just react to them with any emote!

Your listener may also favorite your messages, which saves them for only you (not for the listener). This means they've found something insightful or lovely in what you've said. ^-^

### Privacy

Normal messages are purged from our system after 24 hours, and only reviewed by admin if you've been reported.

Favorited messages are kept until you request them to be deleted.

Messages are only visible to you and your listener, and not directly attached to your discord id.

### After Your Chat

You're welcome to do some post-chat reflection. Reflecting and processing what you just talked about could have positive effects on your journey towards a better quality of life. <3

You can also reconnect with previous listeners if they're available!

## For Listeners

### How We Support Members

When we decide to listen to a member, we enter into their world.

They're the one steering the boat, and we're just helping paddle.

This is peer support, and should not be considered therapy. The focus is them--the goal is to help them reflect on their emotions, their concerns, and their environment in a safe space.

Learning coping mechanisms and developing healthy habits are the most helpful ways for members to start their journey towards an improved quality of life.

You're here to support them, but ultimately they are responsible for their own mental health, so take care, take time, and progress at your own pace. <3

### What Members Should Expect From You

You're a real person trained in active listening, because it's important to have a real human being read what they're saying, process it, and acknowledge them in a way that supports their journey.

You're not allowed to share personal details or give advice.

Remember that the purpose of a chat is to slow down and process thoughts and emotions, so allow yourself and your member time to reflect.

### Active Listening Skills

We engage in active listening by:
- Being fully present in the conversation
- Showing interest in the things they're saying
- Reflecting their emotions
- Paraphrasing their content
- Asking open ended questions

**Let the member lead.** It's important to let them take the lead and not make the situation about us. When they feel like they're in control of the conversation, we can help them be in control of their lives.

### Setting Boundaries

It's important to set limits with members to protect your own well-being & keep the member independent.

This should be done early and as needed.

**Examples:**
- "We're not allowed to take vents outside of the server. We can talk here, though!"
- "I'm sorry, but this is a triggering topic for me. I'll find someone who's more comfortable supporting you through this."
- "Hey, I have about half an hour to chat, what's wrong?"

It's part of our job to prevent unhealthy and toxic relationships from developing. You're here to support them for an hour and send them on their way to do great things!

### Showing Empathy

Empathy is identifying the emotions someone is expressing in yourself.

We can't assume exactly how they're feeling, but we can bring emotions from our past forward to respond to them with compassion.

Empathy isn't about feeling bad **for** them, it's about feeling bad **with** them!

When you show you understand how they're feeling, they'll start to feel better.

### Using Affirmations

Think of a time when you were struggling. When you felt alone and ignored and helpless. All you wanted was some words of encouragement.

This is the power of affirmations.

**Examples:**
- "You deserve a safe space."
- "It's okay to forgive yourself."
- "You made the decision you thought was best, and you're happy with it."

It can be hard to see the good in ourselves sometimes. It takes a gentle hand to help others see their good.

When we subtly encourage members' positive thoughts and behaviors, we help them improve their outlook on life.

### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is repeating what someone has said in our own words.

Rather than parroting them, set checkpoints at the start and throughout the conversation to make sure you fully understand them. This gives them a chance to reflect on what they've said and fill in anything they think is important.

It's important to focus on their emotions and reframe little bits at a time to be positive when we're paraphrasing.

"I failed" becomes "It hasn't been working out."
"I can't" becomes "You're struggling with..."

Supporting others is like laying down tiny pebbles before them until they see the path.

**Examples:**
- "It sounds like you're really struggling with grief right now."
- "You're really angry about this! It sounds frustrating to..."

### Reflecting Emotions

It can be hard to identify for ourselves how we're feeling. Sometimes we know how we feel, but we're just not addressing those emotions.

Identify the emotions your member is expressing, to yourself and in your response to them.

The member will feel more connected to their feelings and to you as a listener if your response matches their emotions.

### Asking Open-Ended Questions

When we ask a yes or no question, it's easy to respond, right?

But what if we ask one that you have to think about?

It's important to help members reveal the "what", "how", and "why" of their thoughts and actions to themselves.

We never ask members questions out of our own curiosity, only to help guide them through their current struggles.

Have you realized the power of open-ended questions?

### Avoiding Advice

It's tempting to give someone advice, especially when they're asking for it.

But it's hard to see the whole picture--they could have other obstacles they haven't shared, or be in a complicated situation we're not aware of.

It's more effective to help someone figure something out on their own, giving them gentle guidance. That way, you can help them use all the information they have to take meaningful actions that stick with them.

**Advice** is telling someone what you think they should do.

**Suggestions** are more effective in helping the member decide for themselves how to change. When they make the decision themselves, it's easier to stick to.

Suggestions are statements followed by an open-ended question.

**Examples:**
- "It **could help** to prioritize things to feel more organized. **What do you think about that?**"
- "Communication is the foundation of all healthy relationships. **How do you feel about that statement?**"
- "Mindfulness **helps some people** with stress. **What are your experiences with it?**"

### Important Notes

Please avoid direct discussion of any criminal activity.

If a member asks for your contact info or username, please report them immediately.

Definitely reach out to mentors if you had a difficult chat or would like to talk! ^-^

### After Your Chat

Supporting others can be difficult sometimes, but it means so much just for them to have someone to talk to.

Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to support our members. Every day, you make the world a little brighter. <3
