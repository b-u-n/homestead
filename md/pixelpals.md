# Pixel Pals

Collaborative pixel art game in the Games Parlor. Players create boards and contribute pixels according to game mode rules. The flow opens fullscreen (`size: 'fullscreen'` on the flow definition).

## Game Modes

### Free Mode
Unlimited drawing with no restrictions. Personal boards only.

- No pixel budget, no cooldowns, no turn order
- Only available when `boardType: 'personal'`
- Backend sets `pixelsRemaining` to 99999999
- Skips all eligibility checks and credit tracking entirely

### Chain Mode
Turn-based drawing. Players take turns in order.

- `chainOrder` array tracks player sequence (join order)
- `currentChainIndex` points to whose turn it is
- Only the current player can draw; others see "Waiting for [name]"
- After drawing, index advances to next player (wraps around)
- Budget: `pixelsPerTurn` per turn

### Daily Drop
Time-based pixel budget. Everyone gets pixels on a schedule.

- `dropInterval`: `'hourly'`, `'daily'`, or `'weekly'`
- Budget refreshes automatically when the interval elapses
- Tracked via `PixelPalsPlayer.boardStates[].lastBudgetRefresh`
- Budget: `pixelsPerTurn` per refresh

### Live Canvas
Free-for-all with cooldown between draws.

- `liveCooldownSeconds`: 30-600 seconds between draw actions
- Pixels refresh every action (no cumulative budget)
- Tracked via `PixelPalsPlayer.boardStates[].lastDrawTime`
- Budget: `pixelsPerTurn` per action

## Board Types

- **Shared** (default): Anyone can draw according to game mode rules
- **Personal**: Only the creator can draw. Others cannot see personal boards in the listing.

Personal boards are filtered out of `pixelPals:boards:list` for non-owners (both backend and frontend).

## Board Sizes

Gated by feature level (see `md/FEATURES.md`):

| Size | Feature Level |
|------|--------------|
| 16x16 | 0 (everyone) |
| 32x32 | 0 (default) |
| 48x48 | 1 |
| Custom (8-64) | 3 |

## Pixels Per Turn

The creator picks from three options computed from board size:
- **1/8** of total pixels (e.g., 128 for 32x32)
- **1/4** of total pixels (e.g., 256 for 32x32)
- **1/2** of total pixels (e.g., 512 for 32x32)

Default is 1/8. Options scale dynamically with the selected board size. Hidden in free mode.

There is no backend max cap on `pixelsPerTurn`.

## Credit System

Drawing costs credits, but repainting an already-painted pixel in the same cycle is free.

- `touchedPixels` on `PixelPalsPlayer.boardStates[]` tracks which `"x,y"` positions have been painted this credit cycle
- Only new positions cost credits; repaints cost 0
- Each contribution records `creditsCost` (actual credits consumed) and `newPositions` (which positions were new)
- **Undo** refunds exactly `creditsCost` from the last contribution and removes `newPositions` from `touchedPixels`
- Free mode skips all credit tracking entirely (`creditCost` always 0, `touchedPixels` not updated)

## Board Completion

Boards complete **automatically** when every pixel is filled (`board.pixels.every(p => p !== null)`). There is no manual complete action.

When the last pixel is placed:
1. PNG generated server-side via `sharp` (`pixelImageService.savePixelArtPNG`)
2. Board status set to `'completed'`, `imageUrl` stored
3. `ShopItem` created with PNG revision (`status: 'pending'`), `sourceBoard` reference, `participantIds`
4. `ModerationQueue` entry created
5. Contributors notified via `createNotification`
6. Draw response includes `autoCompleted: true`
7. After mod approval, item appears in the Bazaar shop

## Purchasing Completed Boards

- Normal pricing via `getPrice(purchaseCount)` (starts at 9 hearts)
- **Participant discount**: Contributors pay only 3 hearts
- `ShopItem.participantIds` tracks contributors
- `ShopItem.sourceBoard` links back to the `PixelBoard`

## UI Layout

Three layout modes detected automatically:

### Desktop
- **Left panel** (~1/6 width): tool buttons (Draw/Paint/Pick/Erase/Undo) with SVG icons, pixel budget, current color swatch, 12 color wheels in 4x3 grid, mini bitmap preview, save button
- **Grid area** (~5/6 width): pixel grid sized to `min(fitWidth, fitHeight)` so it always fits on screen
- Color wheel popup overlay positioned over the clicked pixel (`position: absolute` inside grid container)
- Mouse cursors: custom SVG cursors per tool

### Mobile Landscape
- Uses the **same layout as desktop** (left panel + grid)
- Touch handlers added to grid cells: `onTouchStart` opens wheel in Draw mode, paints in Paint mode
- `onTouchMove`/`onTouchEnd` support drag-painting
- Wheel overlay positioned relative to grid (same as desktop)

### Mobile Portrait
- **Scrollable grid** (80% height): full-width pixels, vertically scrollable if grid is taller than viewport. Minimum cell size 16px for finger taps. Scroll disabled (`overflow: hidden`) while color wheel overlay is open.
- **Bottom panel** (20% height): two sections in a row:
  - **Left column**: tool buttons (horizontal row) + color wheels grid
  - **Right column**: mini bitmap preview filling the panel height
- **Color wheel popup**: `position: fixed`, positioned over the tapped pixel (clamped to screen edges). Tap backdrop to dismiss. Drag on wheel to preview colors.
- Global `touchmove` listener prevents scroll while wheel is open.

### Landing Page
- **Filter bar** at top: type (All/Shared/Mine/Pixel Art), size (Any/16/32/48), mode (Any/Free/Chain/Daily/Live)
- **4-column thumbnail grid** filling the width (dynamic thumb size = container width / 4), centered
- Personal boards show "Solo" badge overlay
- "New Board" button at bottom
- Opens fullscreen (no title bar)

### Create Board (Modal)
- Opens as `size: 'medium'` overlay at `depth: 1` on top of the landing
- Title, size picker, board type, game mode, mode-specific options, pixels-per-turn

## Tools

- **Draw**: Left-click opens color wheel overlay on that pixel. Pick color by dragging over the wheel. Drag the center square to start painting.
- **Paint**: Left-click+drag paints directly with current color. No wheel popup.
- **Pick**: Click a pixel to adopt its color.
- **Erase**: Click+drag to erase (set pixels to null).
- **Undo**: Reverts last stroke. Does not cost credits.

### Shortcuts
- **Double-click** a cell: toggle between Draw and Paint modes
- **Right-click** a filled cell: pick that color (if in Erase mode, switches to Paint)
- **Right-click** an empty cell: switch to Erase mode

## Color System

### Color Wheels (left panel)
12 wheels in a 4x3 grid, each wrapped in a circular `MinkyPanel` with stitched border at 20% opacity:

| Row | Wheels |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Creams, Vibrants Light, Vibrants, Coral |
| 2 | Rust, Gold, Sage, Sky Blue |
| 3 | Purple, Pink, Vibrants Dark, Darks |

Click a wheel to select it. The selected wheel is used for the popup overlay.

### Popup Wheel Overlay
- Opens on left-click in Draw mode, centered on the clicked pixel
- Drag over the wheel to preview colors
- Release to commit the color to that pixel
- Drag the center square to start painting and close the overlay
- Click elsewhere to close and adopt the preview color
- Auto-fades after 12 seconds

### Symmetry Phantoms
Empty pixels show a 10% opacity ghost of their horizontal mirror (x-axis flip). Helps visualize symmetrical compositions.

## Frontend Flow

```
pixelPals:landing ─── viewBoard ──→ pixelPals:canvas

       └── createBoard ──→ pixelPals:create (depth 1, medium modal)
                                │
                                └── created ──→ pixelPals:canvas
